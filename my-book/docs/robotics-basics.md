# Robotics Basics

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of robotics, covering its history, types, key components, and basic principles of motion and control.

## 1. Definition and History of Robotics

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, engineering, and artificial intelligence to design, construct, operate, and apply robots. The term "robot" itself originates from the Czech word "robota," meaning forced labor or work, coined by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots).

The dream of creating intelligent machines dates back to ancient times, with myths and legends featuring automatons. However, modern robotics began to take shape in the 20th century:

*   **1950s:** George Devol invents "Unimate," the first programmable industrial robot.
*   **1960s:** Joseph Engelberger co-founds Unimation Inc., the world's first robot company, leading to the widespread adoption of industrial robots in manufacturing.
*   **1970s-1980s:** Development of robot vision, advanced sensors, and more sophisticated control algorithms.
*   **1990s-Present:** Emergence of mobile robots, humanoid robots, collaborative robots (cobots), and significant advancements in AI, machine learning, and human-robot interaction.

## 2. Types of Robots

Robots come in various forms, each designed for specific tasks and environments:

*   **Industrial Robots:**
    *   **Articulated Robots:** Resemble human arms, with rotary joints. Commonly used for assembly, welding, painting, and material handling.
    *   **SCARA Robots (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm):** High speed and precision for pick-and-place and assembly tasks, typically in a cylindrical workspace.
    *   **Delta Robots:** Parallel manipulators used for high-speed pick-and-place operations, often in food packaging.
    *   **Cartesian/Gantry Robots:** Move along three linear axes (X, Y, Z), suitable for precise linear movements.
*   **Mobile Robots:**
    *   **Wheeled Robots:** Navigate using wheels, common in logistics (AGVs, AMRs), exploration, and domestic applications (robot vacuums).
    *   **Legged Robots:** Mimic animal or human locomotion, offering versatility in uneven terrains. Examples include Boston Dynamics' Spot and Atlas.
    *   **Aerial Robots (Drones):** Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used for surveillance, delivery, mapping, and photography.
*   **Humanoid Robots:** Designed to resemble the human body, capable of human-like interactions and tasks. Examples include ASIMO, Atlas, and Sophia.
*   **Collaborative Robots (Cobots):** Designed to work alongside humans in a shared workspace, often with built-in safety features to ensure human well-being.
*   **Service Robots:** Operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans, excluding industrial automation applications. This includes medical robots, cleaning robots, and delivery robots.

## 3. Key Components of a Robot

A typical robot system comprises several essential components working in synergy:

*   **Manipulators (Robot Arm):** The mechanical structure of the robot, consisting of a series of links connected by joints. These links and joints allow the robot to move and position its end-effector.
*   **End-Effectors:** The "hand" of the robot, attached to the manipulator's end. It interacts with the environment and performs the actual task. Examples include grippers, welding torches, paint sprayers, and specialized tools.
*   **Sensors:** Devices that gather information about the robot's internal state and its external environment.
    *   **Internal Sensors:** Measure joint positions, motor speeds, forces/torques within the robot.
    *   **External Sensors:** Detect environmental features (vision sensors, proximity sensors, force/torque sensors, tactile sensors) to enable navigation, object recognition, and interaction.
*   **Actuators:** Components that convert energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic) into mechanical motion. They are responsible for driving the robot's joints. Common types include electric motors (DC, AC, stepper, servo) and hydraulic/pneumatic cylinders.
*   **Controllers:** The "brain" of the robot, processing sensor data, executing programs, and sending commands to the actuators. It manages motion planning, trajectory generation, and interaction with other systems.

## 4. Basic Kinematics

Kinematics deals with the geometry of motion without considering the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, it primarily focuses on the spatial relationship between the robot's joints and its end-effector.

*   **Forward Kinematics:**
    *   Calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector given the angles or displacements of all the robot's joints.
    *   It's a straightforward calculation using transformation matrices (e.g., Denavit-Hartenberg parameters) to chain together the transformations from one joint to the next.
    *   Input: Joint variables (angles, displacements)
    *   Output: End-effector pose (position and orientation)
*   **Inverse Kinematics:**
    *   Calculates the required joint angles or displacements needed to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector.
    *   This is generally more complex than forward kinematics and can have multiple solutions, no solutions, or singularities.
    *   Input: Desired end-effector pose
    *   Output: Joint variables

## 5. Basic Dynamics

Robot dynamics involves the study of the forces and torques that cause motion. It considers the mass, inertia, and external forces acting on the robot.

*   **Lagrangian Dynamics:** A common approach to formulating the equations of motion for a robot. It uses energy concepts (kinetic and potential energy) to derive dynamic equations.
*   **Newton-Euler Dynamics:** Another method that applies Newton's second law and Euler's equations to each link of the robot, considering forces and moments.

Dynamics is crucial for:
*   **Control System Design:** Understanding how forces affect motion allows for the design of controllers that can accurately achieve desired trajectories.
*   **Robot Design:** Optimizing robot structure and material for stability, speed, and payload capacity.
*   **Force Control:** Enabling robots to interact with their environment by applying or sensing forces.

## 6. Control Architectures

Robot control architectures define how the robot's perception, planning, and action systems are organized.

*   **Open-Loop Control:**
    *   The controller sends commands to the actuators without using feedback from sensors to verify if the desired action was achieved.
    *   Simple and inexpensive, but highly sensitive to disturbances and inaccuracies in the robot model or environment.
    *   Suitable for tasks where the environment is well-known and predictable, and precision is not paramount.
*   **Closed-Loop Control (Feedback Control):**
    *   The controller continuously compares the actual state of the robot (measured by sensors) with the desired state.
    *   It then calculates and applies corrective actions to minimize the error.
    *   Provides accuracy, robustness to disturbances, and adaptability.
    *   **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control:** A widely used feedback control loop mechanism.
        *   **Proportional (P):** Reacts to the current error.
        *   **Integral (I):** Addresses accumulated past errors (eliminates steady-state error).
        *   **Derivative (D):** Anticipates future errors based on the rate of change of error.

These foundational concepts are essential for understanding more advanced topics in physical AI and humanoid robotics.
