This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of robotics, covering its history, types, key components, and basic principles of motion and control.

#### 1. Definition and History of Robotics
*   **Definition:** Robotics is an interdisciplinary field integrating computer science, engineering, and AI to design, construct, operate, and apply robots. The term "robot" comes from the Czech "robota" (forced labor) from Karel Čapek's 1920 play "R.U.R."
*   **History:** Traces the evolution from ancient automatons to modern robotics, highlighting key milestones such as the invention of "Unimate" (the first programmable industrial robot) in the 1950s, the founding of Unimation Inc., and advancements in robot vision, sensors, AI, and human-robot interaction through the present day.

#### 2. Types of Robots
*   **Industrial Robots:** Details articulated, SCARA, Delta, and Cartesian/Gantry robots used in manufacturing for tasks like assembly, welding, and material handling.
*   **Mobile Robots:** Discusses wheeled, legged (e.g., Boston Dynamics' Spot, Atlas), and aerial robots (drones) for logistics, exploration, surveillance, and more.
*   **Humanoid Robots:** Describes robots designed to resemble humans, focusing on human-like interactions and tasks (e.g., ASIMO, Atlas, Sophia).
*   **Collaborative Robots (Cobots):** Explains robots designed to work safely alongside humans in shared workspaces.
*   **Service Robots:** Covers autonomous or semi-autonomous robots providing services for human well-being, excluding industrial applications, like medical, cleaning, delivery robots.

#### 3. Key Components of a Robot
*   **Manipulators (Robot Arm):** The mechanical structure of links and joints for movement.
*   **End-Effectors:** The "hand" of the robot that interacts with the environment (e.g., grippers, torches).
*   **Sensors:** Devices gathering internal (joint positions) and external (vision, proximity, force/torque) information.
*   **Actuators:** Components converting energy into mechanical motion, driving robot joints (e.g., electric motors, hydraulic cylinders).
*   **Controllers:** The "brain" processing data, executing programs, and managing motion.

#### 4. Basic Kinematics
*   **Forward Kinematics:** Calculates end-effector position and orientation from known joint variables.
*   **Inverse Kinematics:** Determines the required joint variables to achieve a desired end-effector pose, noting its greater complexity and potential for multiple solutions.

#### 5. Basic Dynamics
*   Studies the forces and torques causing motion, considering mass, inertia, and external forces.
*   Discusses **Lagrangian Dynamics** (energy-based) and **Newton-Euler Dynamics** (force/moment-based) for formulating equations of motion.
*   Highlights its importance for control system design, robot design, and force control.

#### 6. Control Architectures
*   **Open-Loop Control:** Explains systems where commands are sent without sensor feedback, suitable for predictable environments.
*   **Closed-Loop Control (Feedback Control):** Describes systems that continuously compare actual and desired states, applying corrective actions for accuracy and robustness.
*   Introduces **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control** as a widely used feedback mechanism, detailing the roles of P, I, and D components.
